# ETL and Big Data Processing Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the fundamental concepts of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) in Big Data environments. It provides a comprehensive understanding of how to extract, transform, and load large volumes of data from external sources into analytical systems like Tableau. The project aims to analyze gender inequality and mental health between men and women worldwide using dashboards built from processed data.

## Technologies Used
- **Containers**: For scalable and portable deployment
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for writing and executing Python code
- **Apache Spark**: Distributed data processing
- **Hadoop HDFS**: Distributed file system for large-scale data storage
- **Tableau**: Data visualization and dashboard creation

## Project Scope
- **Data Extraction**: Collect data from multiple external sources related to gender inequality
- **Data Transformation**: Clean, preprocess, and format the data for analysis
- **Data Loading**: Store the processed data in Hadoop HDFS and make it available for analysis
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Use Apache Spark for processing and Tableau for dashboard creation
